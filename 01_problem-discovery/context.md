# Context and Problem Definition

## Background
- **Environment:** Public transportation in Israel (buses/trains) with varying levels of crowding during peak hours.  
- **Primary users:** Daily commuters (students, employees), parents with children, and passengers who frequently switch lines.  
- **Current status:** Crowding reports are sporadic and partial; data is inconsistent and trust in real-time crowding information is low.  

## Core Problem
- **Short description:** Passengers cannot reliably avoid crowded vehicles due to insufficient or unreliable crowding reports.  
- **Who is affected and how:** Riders miss opportunities to choose less crowded trips, experience discomfort, and face delays.  
- **Observed reality:** Even when reports exist, they often arrive too late or contradict each other; many passengers do not report because it feels like “extra effort” without benefit.  

## Product Opportunity
- **Value to users:** Better travel decisions, more comfortable and transparent experience, sense of control.  
- **Value to operators/business:** Improved customer satisfaction, reduced crowding on problematic lines, stronger data foundation for planning.  
- **Why now:** Growing complaints about overcrowding, combined with widespread mobile usage enabling community-driven real-time data collection.  

## Initial Hypotheses and Validation
- **Hypothesis #1:** Reducing friction in reporting (one-click action) will significantly increase reporting rates.  
- **Hypothesis #2:** Immediate feedback and light incentives (contribution badges/micro-animations) will boost trust and participation.  
- **Preliminary evidence (informal sources):** App store reviews mentioning crowding, posts in transportation communities, short interviews with 5–7 daily commuters.  

## Scope and Non-goals
- **In scope:** One-click crowding report button; display of crowding levels on route screen; algorithm for balancing conflicting reports.  
- **Out of scope:** External IoT/camera integrations; changes to pricing or line frequency; monetary incentive models.  

## Initial Success Metrics
- **Adoption metric (Primary):** Percentage of active users submitting at least one report per week.  
- **Data quality metric (Secondary):** Consistency of reports for the same line/trip within a 10-minute window.  
- **Experience/trust metric (Secondary):** Percentage of crowding views that lead to changes in route planning.
