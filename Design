# 🎨 Design

## Overview
The design focuses on making crowding reporting effortless and crowding information easy to understand. Simplicity and clarity are prioritized to encourage adoption and build rider trust.

---

## Design Principles
- **Low friction**: Reporting should take no more than one tap.
- **Clarity**: Crowding indicators must be simple and universally understood.
- **Consistency**: Visual language aligned with existing transit app UI.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG-compliant colors, text, and icons.

---

## User Flow

### Reporting
1. **In-ride widget**: Riders see a floating button to report crowding.
2. **One-tap action**: Tap once to select crowding level (low/medium/high).
3. **Confirmation**: Subtle toast message confirms submission.
4. **Post-ride prompt**: Optional notification asking for feedback after disembarking.

### Viewing
1. **Trip planner**: Crowding indicators displayed alongside route options.
2. **Vehicle detail screen**: Real-time crowding level shown with icon + text.
3. **Consistency check**: Confidence score subtly indicated (e.g., “High confidence”).

## Visual Elements
- **Crowding scale**: Three levels represented by icons and color coding:
  - Green = Low crowding
  - Yellow = Medium crowding
  - Red = High crowding
- **Reporting button**: Circular floating action button with crowd icon.
- **Confidence indicator**: Small badge (✓ High, ~ Medium, ? Low).

---

## Wireframe Concepts
- **Reporting widget**: Minimalist button with three selectable states.
- **Trip planner integration**: Crowding icons next to departure times.
- **Post-ride prompt**: Lightweight card with “How crowded was your ride?” and three options.

## Accessibility Considerations
- Color-blind friendly palette (use icons + text, not color alone).
- Tap targets ≥ 44px for mobile usability.
- Screen reader labels for crowding levels and reporting actions.

---

## Next Steps
- Validate wireframes with 5–10 riders in usability testing.
- Iterate on iconography and color palette based on accessibility feedback.
- Prepare high-fidelity Figma prototypes for engineering handoff.
