# 📊 Experiments & Analytics

## Overview
To validate our strategy and PRD, we will run structured experiments and track analytics that measure adoption, data quality, and rider satisfaction. Each experiment is tied to a hypothesis and success metric.

## Experiment Design

### Experiment 1: One-Tap Reporting
- **Hypothesis**: One-tap reporting increases participation
- **Method**: A/B test — one-tap widget vs. standard reporting flow
- **Metrics**: % of MAU reporting weekly, time-to-report, completion rate
- **Duration**: 4 weeks
- **Success Criteria**: +20% reporters/MAU

### Experiment 2: Post-Ride Prompt
- **Hypothesis**: Post-ride prompt improves data quality
- **Method**: A/B test — immediate vs. post-ride prompt
- **Metrics**: Agreement rate across overlapping reports, opt-out rate
- **Duration**: 4 weeks
- **Success Criteria**: +15% consistency

### Experiment 3: Simplified 3-Level Display
- **Hypothesis**: Simplified crowding display boosts trust
- **Method**: A/B test — 3-level vs. 5-level crowding UI
- **Metrics**: Net Experience Score (NXS), trip re-routing based on crowding info
- **Duration**: 6 weeks
- **Success Criteria**: +10 NXS uplift

## Analytics Plan

### Dashboards
- **Adoption Dashboard**
  - Reporters/MAU trend
  - Tap-through rate on prompts
  - Reporting flow completion funnel

- **Data Quality Dashboard**
  - Agreement rate across overlapping reports
  - False-positive crowding alerts
  - Confidence score distribution

- **Satisfaction Dashboard**
  - Net Experience Score (NXS)
  - Post-ride survey accuracy feedback
  - Trip re-routing behavior

### Leading Indicators
- Tap-through rate on reporting prompts
- Median time-to-report
- Drop-off at each step in reporting flow

### Guardrails
- False-positive crowding alerts ≤ 10%
- Notification opt-out rate ≤ 15%
- Data aggregation latency ≤ 30s (p95)

## Tools & Instrumentation
- **Event tracking**: In-app analytics SDK (e.g., Mixpanel, Amplitude)
- **Surveys**: Post-ride micro-surveys for satisfaction
- **Data pipeline**: Aggregation + confidence scoring in backend
- **Visualization**: Dashboards in BI tool (e.g., Looker, Tableau)

---

## Next Steps
- Implement event tracking for reporting flow
- Launch first A/B test (one-tap reporting)
- Monitor dashboards weekly and iterate based on results
