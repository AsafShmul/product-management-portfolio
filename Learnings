# 📚 Learnings

## Overview
This section reflects on what worked well, what challenges we faced, and how the project shaped my approach as a product manager. Documenting learnings ensures continuous improvement and demonstrates growth mindset.

## Key Learnings

### 1. Adoption Requires Simplicity
- Riders are more likely to participate when reporting is frictionless.
- One-tap reporting significantly lowered barriers compared to multi-step flows.
- **Takeaway**: Always prioritize ease of use in feature design.

### 2. Data Quality Improves with Structured Prompts
- Post-ride prompts yielded more consistent reports than in-ride submissions.
- Confidence scoring helped filter out noisy data.
- **Takeaway**: Data reliability depends on both UX design and backend validation.

### 3. Trust is Built Through Transparency
- Riders trusted crowding indicators more when they understood how data was aggregated.
- Simplified 3-level display reduced confusion compared to granular scales.
- **Takeaway**: Clear communication of how features work increases user confidence.

### 4. Experimentation is Essential
- A/B testing revealed unexpected behaviors (e.g., some riders ignored prompts but engaged with passive indicators).
- Iteration based on analytics was key to refining the product.
- **Takeaway**: Hypotheses must be tested, not assumed.

### 5. Balance Between Engagement and Fatigue
- Frequent prompts risked notification fatigue.
- Lightweight gamification (streaks, badges) encouraged participation without overwhelming users.
- **Takeaway**: Engagement tactics must be balanced with user tolerance.

## Personal Growth as a PM
- Strengthened skills in **prioritization** (RICE framework) and **trade-off analysis**.
- Improved ability to design **measurable success metrics** and guardrails.
- Learned to connect **user research → strategy → PRD → design → experiments → GTM** in a cohesive narrative.
- Developed a deeper appreciation for **cross-functional collaboration** (design, engineering, data).

## What I’d Do Differently Next Time
- Involve riders earlier in co-design workshops to validate assumptions.
- Explore agency partnerships sooner to align incentives.
- Build stronger feedback loops between reporting and visible outcomes for riders.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrated the importance of simplicity, transparency, and experimentation in product development. It reinforced that successful products are not just built — they are continuously tested, refined, and communicated clearly to users.
