# 🚀 Strategy

## Overview
Based on rider complaints and low participation in crowding reports, our strategy focuses on **increasing adoption, improving data quality, and boosting rider trust**. We will prioritize initiatives using the RICE framework, define clear success metrics, and establish testable hypotheses to guide experiments.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Increase rider participation in crowding reporting  
- Improve consistency and reliability of submitted data  
- Enhance rider satisfaction and trust in real-time information

## 📊 RICE Prioritization

| Initiative                         | Reach (MAU) | Impact (1–3) | Confidence (0–1) | Effort (pw) | RICE Score |
|------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|------------------|-------------|------------|
| One-tap reporting widget           | 60k         | 2.0          | 0.7              | 3           | 28,000     |
| Post-ride reporting prompt         | 40k         | 1.5          | 0.6              | 2           | 18,000     |
| Confidence scoring (cross-checks)  | 60k         | 1.2          | 0.6              | 4           | 10,800     |
| Simplified crowding display (3 lv) | 80k         | 1.3          | 0.8              | 2           | 41,600     |
| Gamified streaks                   | 30k         | 1.1          | 0.5              | 3           | 5,500      |

**Top priorities:**  
1. Simplified crowding display (highest RICE score, broad reach, high confidence)  
2. One-tap reporting widget (strong impact, medium effort)

## 📈 Success Metrics

- **Adoption**  
  - % of MAU submitting reports weekly  
  - Target: +20% reporters/MAU  

- **Data Quality**  
  - Agreement rate across overlapping reports  
  - Target: +30% consistency  

- **Satisfaction**  
  - Net Experience Score (NXS) uplift  
  - Target: +10 points  

**Leading indicators:** tap-through rate on prompts, time-to-report, drop-off in reporting flow  
**Guardrails:** false-positive alerts, opt-out rate, latency of data aggregation

## 🧪 Hypotheses

- **H1: One-tap reporting increases participation**  
  - Mechanism: reduce friction to a single action  
  - Prediction: +20% reporters/MAU  
  - Test: A/B — one-tap vs. standard flow  

- **H2: Post-ride prompt improves data quality**  
  - Mechanism: riders reflect after disembarking  
  - Prediction: +15% consistency  
  - Test: A/B — immediate vs. post-ride prompt  

- **H3: Simplified 3-level display boosts trust**  
  - Mechanism: lower cognitive load vs. 5 levels  
  - Prediction: +10 NXS uplift  
  - Test: A/B — 3-level vs. 5-level UI
