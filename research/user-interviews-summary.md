# User Interviews Summary

## Methodology
- **Number of participants:** 7  
- **Profile of participants:** University students, parents with toddlers, office workers commuting daily.  
- **Format:** Short semi-structured interviews (15–20 minutes each).  
- **Duration:** Conducted over one week.  

## Key Findings
1. **Pain Points:** Reports are inconsistent, often outdated, and sometimes contradictory.  
2. **Motivations:** Users want reliable, real-time information to avoid crowded rides and reduce stress.  
3. **Behaviors:** Most commuters check apps before leaving home or while waiting at the station.  
4. **Barriers to reporting:** Reporting feels like extra effort; users don’t see immediate benefit.  

## Representative Quotes
- "I just want to know if the bus will be packed before I get on."  
- "If I know the bus is full, I’ll wait for the next one."  
- "Switching lines is stressful enough — I need accurate info to make it smoother."  

## Insights
- **Trust gap:** Users don’t rely on crowding data because it’s inconsistent.  
- **Ease of reporting:** A one-click report could significantly increase participation.  
- **Feedback loop:** Users want acknowledgment or small incentives when they contribute.  

## Next Steps
- Validate hypotheses with a larger sample size.  
- Prototype one-click reporting and test adoption in a pilot.  
- Explore lightweight incentives (badges, micro-animations) to encourage participation.
